    <h2>Blink, GoDot Engine, Academic</h2>
    <h3>"Blink" was the first video game I had ever created with an academic grading. 
        I was the artist and designer. Brandon Zhou was the programmer and manager. 
        We got the music from Ross Bugden in YouTube creative commons. 
        Even though I was the artist and desginer, I also helped with programming when my partner had no time.
        I fixed bugs and designed the entire map. Although there were many things we wanted to add, we
        were under a time constraint and never finshed. I plan on making a sequel of this game which 
        will implement the scrapped ideas I had.

    <h2>Rescue Eve, GoDot Engine, Academic</h2>
    <h3>"Rescue Eve" is another game I helped created with an academic grading. 
        I was an artist and designer. I helped with a little bit of coding such as movement.
        This game is about a funky dancing robot. He is on a journey to locate his companion. 
        It is a action platformer with an odd disco dancing theme. 
        There are only 5 levels of the game. Others who also worked on this project were 
        Linhson(Programmer), Jed(Programmer), and Alison(Artist).
