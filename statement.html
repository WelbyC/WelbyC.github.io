  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My name is Welby Chan. <em>I am a software engineer major, but I also consider myself an artist</em>. Ever since I was a child, stories always piqued my interest. To be precise fictional stories, but also stories with a deeper meaning. Those are the stories that leave an impression and change who you are. I want to create art that tells a story with a meaning behind them that can leave impressions.</p>
  <p>Usually, I create stories through words, but presenting it through videos and pictures has been fun and interesting. Lately I have been doing just that. The work I made on my portfolio website all reflect some sort of story told either through non-narrative or montages. To explore these ideas, I try to pick out a theme and use my personal experiences to represent them.
