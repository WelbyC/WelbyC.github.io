  <h2>Change, Montage, 2018</h2>
  <h3>Change is the first video in my path as an artist. I was told to first make sounds using a recording device and then to record videos to put together with the recorded sounds. The meaning of "Change" is simple. Even when you want to change and make progress, we all go back to how we were, eventually restarting back at 0. Change is easy, yet so hard.</h3>

  <h2>Reflection of the Rain, Non-narative, 2018 </h2>
  <h3>We all have a reflection. That reflection deep down shows a story that no one but the reflected truly understands. Water is clear like glass, yet it stares back at you and shows you who you are.</h3>

 <h2>Viral, Net Art, 2018</h2>
 <h3>This pece is a Net Art piece. It is about how the culture today involves things going viral. It cannot be stopped by any power. No matter how hard one tries, it would only grow bigger until it dies out on its own. Probing at it will only make it grow bigger. One is example is the zoo that owned harambe.</h3>
